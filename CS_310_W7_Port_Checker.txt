1. How did you check if a port was being used?

I used netstat -t to get a list of all the THC ports being used. I first skipped 
over the first 2 rows then I only took the second half of the fourth column of the 
remaining rows, because that was the port number.


2. How did you handle the verbose flag?

I used an if statement to check if -v, --verbose, or nothing was inputed as args. 
Every other case is handled by my program.

3. Since this script may require root, how did you warn the user about this?

It would only require root if the -p flag was used on netstat to show the process
names, which was not an abilty provided in the port-check. Thus, I didn't have to
warn the user.
